WaterSaver - Android App

	This project is aimed to help people monitor their water usage when they are taking a shower or using water through other taps and sources. In the future, this project will aim to help people lower their water usage. The android app shows users the rate at which they are currently using water, and how much water they have used in the past day. The information is also presented in graph form. The information is received from a server through the use of the MQTT protocol and also HTTP REST requests.
